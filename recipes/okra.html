    <h3>okra</h3>
    <p>Kurkuri Bhindi is a spicy, tasty and super crispy fries made with tender okra pods or ladies finger, gram flour and spices.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>2 tablespoons safflower oil or grapeseed oil</li>
<li>½ teaspoon black or brown mustard seeds,½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 large onion, thinly sliced,
    1 1/4 pounds okra, trimmed and sliced 1/2 inch thick (about 5 cups sliced),
     or two 10-ounce bags<br>frozen sliced okra, thawed</li>
<li>8 -10 fresh curry leaves</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground coriander,
    1 teaspoon paprika,
    ¾ teaspoon kosher salt,
    ½ teaspoon ground turmeric,
    1/2-1 teaspoon hot Indian chili powder,<br> such as reshampatti, or 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat
             until hot but not smoking. Sprinkle in a few mustard
              seeds to test the oil--it's hot<br> enough when the seeds
               sizzle and pop. Quickly add the remaining mustard seeds, 
               cumin seeds and curry leaves (if using); cook, stirring,
                <br>until very fragrant, about 1 minute, covering the pan as needed to contain any splattering.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium, add onion and cook, stirring, until 
            it is starting to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add okra, increase
             heat to medium-high and <br>cook, stirring often, until the "goo" 
             or mucilage from the okra starts to release and the onion darkens,
              4 to 6 minutes more.
            </li>
          <li>
            Add coriander, paprika, salt, turmeric and chili powder to taste 
            (or cayenne); cook, stirring often, until the okra is browned in 
            spots and the<br> vegetables look very dry, 6 to 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
